	<h1>About Feels Now - Leadnow Feels on Demand</h2>
	<div>
	<p>
     Here's an oasis for those days when you feel like you haven't made any progress or you've been sitting in the Leadnow general inbox feeling like every other email in response to your latest campaign is another curse-word laden rotten tomato thrown at you. This site was built as a tool to remind the core team that for every nasty email, there's probably 10 nicer emails and community feels to combat that negativity.
  	</p>
  <br />
  	<p>This simple web application was built as a side project by your friendly neighbourhood Operations Manager, Danielle as part of a dual effort to brush up on her web development skills and bring all of you wonderful people at Leadnow the feels to fuel the work you do, day in and day out.</p>
  <br />
	  <p> Have you read a nice email lately? Seen a top Facebook comment that made your day? Talked to energized volunteers? Heard something heartwarming in the field?

 <p><b>P.S.</b> Please do not share any names or sensitive information on this site. Keep comments general, anonymous and of course touchy feely #privacypolicy #compliance<br />
